# GeoPlayer
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files.

PROJECT SPECIFICATION<br>

The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app. A similarly structured app which focuses on audiobooks, podcasts, or other audio media is also acceptable.<br>
Each activity is clearly labelled, using a TextView, such that the final purpose of such an activity is easy to understand. For instance, one screen might be labelled ‘song detail screen’ and another might be labelled ‘music library’.<br>
Any activity that requires an external library or class not yet covered includes the name of that library or class. For instance, a payment screen might include information on how to process the payment.<br>
The app contains 3 to 6 activities.<br>
The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together make a cohesive music app.<br>
Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.<br>
Each activity contains buttons which link it to other activities a user should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, a ‘library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘now playing’ activity.<br>
The code adheres to all of the following best practices:<br>
•	Text sizes are defined in sp<br>
•	Lengths are defined in dp<br>
•	Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.<br>
